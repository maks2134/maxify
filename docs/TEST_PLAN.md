## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Test Plan document outlines the testing strategy for Maxify, a personal music streaming service built with Go microservices backend and Next.js frontend. The plan ensures that all functional and non-functional requirements specified in the SRS are thoroughly validated.
