## 7. Recommendations

### 7.1 Critical Issues
No critical issues found during testing.

### 7.2 High Priority Issues
1. **File Upload MIME Type Validation (DEF-001)**
   - **Issue:** MP3 files are being detected as "application/octet-stream" instead of "audio/mpeg"
   - **Recommendation:** Implement more flexible MIME type detection or allow file extension-based validation
   - **Impact:** Prevents users from uploading audio files, blocking core functionality

### 7.3 Medium Priority Issues
1. **JWT Token Expiration (DEF-002)**
   - **Issue:** Tokens expire too quickly during testing sessions
   - **Recommendation:** Consider extending token lifetime for development or implement refresh token mechanism
   - **Impact:** Reduces user experience during testing and development

2. **Upload Page Usability Assessment (DEF-003)**
   - **Issue:** Cannot assess upload page usability due to technical blocking
   - **Recommendation:** Fix file upload issue first, then conduct usability testing
   - **Impact:** Incomplete UX assessment for critical functionality

### 7.4 Low Priority Issues
No low priority issues identified.

### 7.5 General Recommendations
1. **Complete Test Coverage:** Continue testing remaining functionality including playlist management, search, and audio streaming
2. **Security Testing:** Implement comprehensive security testing including SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF protection
3. **Performance Testing:** Conduct load testing with multiple concurrent users
4. **Browser Compatibility:** Test across all supported browsers and devices
5. **Error Handling:** Improve error messages for better user experience
6. **Documentation:** Update API documentation with current endpoint specifications
